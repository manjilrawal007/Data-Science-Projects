    "\n",
    "From these visualizations, several key themes emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Levels of Daily Usage**  \n",
    "   - Many students spend **4–7 hours per day** on social media, which is a substantial portion of their free time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dominant Platforms**  \n",
    "   - A small number of platforms (especially Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube) are used by most students.  \n",
    "   - These platforms likely drive much of the observed screen time and potential addiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perceived Academic Impact**  \n",
    "   - The count plot indicates how many students feel their academic performance is affected.  \n",
    "   - If \"Yes\" responses are high, this provides evidence for further investigation into productivity and grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Group Differences**  \n",
    "   - Average usage by gender shows small but noticeable differences, suggesting that some groups may be more exposed  \n",
    "     to the risks of heavy social media use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Relationships Among Variables**  \n",
    "   - The scatter plot between usage and mental health shows how well-being scores vary with screen time.  \n",
    "   - The correlation heatmap highlights links between addiction scores, conflicts, sleep, and mental health,  \n",
    "     which can motivate more detailed statistical modeling in future work.\n",
    "\n",
